I started running recently, both on road and in life.On road,because it's fun and in life in search of joy. I participated in a semi-marathon recently and it was such a nice experience! Watching the crowd with a smile, running towards the end not to win but to finish. I wanted to do it again and I was excited when I came to know about the **TCS 10K RUN** , but disappointingly the registration has already come to an end.

But I still had this chance to watch the run and find some inspiration from these people to run more in future.I went to Kanteerava stadium, Bengaluru by 6.00 am , parked my bike and walked some 100 mts when I saw this

I can't catch the beginning nor could see the end of the crowd. It's massive, Its Gigantic.. Early morning, where do they come from? The whole Bengaluru, I could imagine here. I "walked" for 4km along with the crowd and still i could see people coming. I decided to stand at a place and cheer up the crowd not knowing I ll get cheered rather. I walked to my friend who is standing to cheer up along with his mates through Dance.!

> Eat, Sleep, Work.. DANCE

Thank You TCS,

Till here everything looks fun and joyful, but

Ms. Shalini, the blade runner. Her determination to run 10K in open category. How to explain her? She might have seen a lot in her life. But Khudoos to her I wish I could run along with her to learn life lessons myself. She proved the power of will to the young champs out there. \_/\\\_

I witnessed the unbelievable truth,

Thank you TCS.!

There are more to learn, the meaning of happiness, the understanding of life. We complain alot, not seeing what we have. But, they don't feel the same. Their joy of living make others envy. You seriously have lot guts and strong heart to do this.

No Limits, that's what they say..

Yes, they are true.. there are no limits for things to go magical. PH is just a category heart is something which is makes one strong. If I am a person running I would have ran only to finish. But, this man down here did more than that.

Appreciating the volunteers for the support they are giving to the runners. He told every volunteer he met,

> Great work, Hail India, I love my people, my country.

I learnt to appreciate good,even I am damn busy, even I am at my own business no matter what.!

Thank you TCS.!

To make a difference you don't have to be inside the box, You can be out of box as well and make things smooth inside. People are not behind the stage to set it up. They stand behind the stage to hold it up.

Humanity, another lesson. Thank you TCS.!

Whatever it may be, experience counts. They might have seen all the levels of life. All the hardships to achieve many. They could rest but the inner one did not let them. Something is still there to show more magic in life. Inspiring the young ones. Granny's.. Nah.. they are not old anymore. They are young granny's.. They proved Age is just a number not an obstacle.

The dance team, the work they did, the steps they composed, the sleepless nights they had.. worth it guys. You made the moment more special with your energy. ![IMG_0584](images/img_0584.jpg)![IMG_0594](images/img_0594.jpg)![IMG_0598](images/img_0598.jpg)

They just didn't dance but created awareness too.. They told not just fun but family also is waiting over there. Have a safe ride.

These are moments in life to feel.! Lessons to be learnt to understand. Missing the registration to run, thought me more.

I'm "not thanking" my two lovely friends who are the main reason I could witness more than what I thought. Of-course they are part of the dance crew. ;)
