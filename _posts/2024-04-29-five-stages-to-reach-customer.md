Diffusion of innovation is a fascinating theory formulated by E.M. Rogers in the 1960s. It describes how an idea or innovation gains momentum and spreads over time. I'd like to discuss a specific aspect of this theory: Innovative decision process.  

The decision-making process regarding an innovation is not instantaneous for customers; instead, it involves a series of distinct actions.

## The innovation decision process consists of five stages:
1. **Knowledge** - The customer is introduced to the innovation and learns about its features and capabilities.
2. **Persuasion** - Based on the knowledge acquired, the customer forms either a favorable or unfavorable opinion about the innovation.
3. **Decision** - The customer engages in activities that lead to either adopting or rejecting the innovation.
4. **Implementation** - The customer begins using the innovation and may customize it to fit their needs.
5. **Confirmation** - The customer seeks confirmation of the decision they have made, which may still be reversed depending on new information or experiences.

Let us deep dive into each of these stages and understand better. 

## Knowledge Stage:

This stage involves the customer becoming aware of the innovation's existence and learning about its functions and operations. There is often debate over whether the need for the innovation or awareness of the innovation comes first. This can depend on the specific innovation, varying from one product or service to another.

Sources of knowledge about an innovation can be passive, such as accidental discoveries, interactions with peers, or other forms of communication.

Customers generally seek out innovations that align with their interests, needs, and attitudes, and they tend to avoid messages that conflict with their preferences. This avoidance is referred to as selective exposure, where customers actively seek information that resonates with their personal inclinations.

Selective exposure often leads to selective perception, where customers interpret information in ways that align with their pre-existing beliefs and interests.
Typically, customers look for the following types of information about an innovation:
- What is innovation?
- How does it work?
- Why does it work?



## Persuasion Stage:

![Persuasion Stage](/assets/images/persuasionstage.jpeg)

In this stage, customers form opinions about the innovation, which can be either favourable or unfavourable, largely depending on whether the right target audience has been reached. A customer's attitude may also be influenced by their existing beliefs.

During the knowledge stage, the customer's mental engagement is primarily about understanding the product. In contrast, the persuasion stage involves an emotional connection, where attitudes towards the product begin to shift. This stage sees customers becoming more psychologically involved with the innovation as they actively seek and interpret credible information, bringing them closer to the product.
This stage also involves forward planning, with customers asking themselves, "What if I adopt this innovation? What happens next?" It's crucial to address these questions to guide them through the decision process.

Customers are likely to seek out FAQs about the innovation, as well as its advantages and disadvantages, to resolve any concerns before moving to the next step.

The main outcome of the persuasion stage is the formation of a definite attitude—either favourable or unfavourable. Even if the attitude is positive, it does not necessarily mean that all customers will adopt the product. This difference between knowing, feeling favourable towards, and actually practising (using) the innovation is often referred to as the **KAP-gap** (Knowledge, Attitude, Practice).



## Decision Stage:

![Decision Stage](/assets/images/decisionstage.jpeg)

In this stage, customers participate in activities that lead them to decide whether to adopt or reject the innovation. Adoption refers to the decision to fully utilise the innovation as the best course of action, whereas rejection means deciding against adopting the innovation.

A crucial method for making this decision is hands-on experience. Although not always possible, this is especially viable with Software as a Service (SaaS) where customers can use a trial period. Innovations offering free trials tend to have a higher conversion rate compared to those that do not offer such trials, such as most hardware innovations.

Demonstrations of the product can also accelerate the decision-making process. Demonstrations are particularly effective when conducted by opinion leaders or influencers, as they add credibility and reduce the time needed to make a decision.

While much focus is often on adoption, it's equally important to discuss rejection. Not every innovation will suit every potential customer; some may find their current solutions sufficient. Rejection of the innovation can occur actively or passively. Active rejection involves considering the innovation but ultimately deciding against it, which includes individuals who have participated in a free trial. Passive rejection, or non-adoption, occurs when the innovation is never considered as an option.


## Implementation Stage:

![Implementation Stage](/assets/images/implementation.jpeg)

The implementation stage marks the transition from mental deliberation to practical use of the innovation. Up to this point, the customer's engagement with the innovation has been a theoretical exercise of weighing the pros and cons. However, in the implementation stage, this becomes an overt action as the customer begins to use the innovation. Even after deciding to adopt, customers often face several practical challenges:

1. **How do I use it effectively?**
2. **What operational problems might arise?**
3. **How can these issues be resolved?**

Active information seeking is crucial during this phase, particularly when the user is an organisation rather than an individual. In organisational settings, the decision to implement an innovation involves multiple stakeholders, adding complexity to the process.

Implementation can be a lengthy or time-consuming process depending on the nature of the innovation. During this phase, new ideas may become institutionalised, potentially causing the innovation to lose its unique appeal and leading to its re-invention.

However, re-invention is often viewed positively. Despite some researchers' reservations, many adopters see re-invention as a desirable feature, believing it reduces errors and enhances the scope for customization.

**Main reasons for re-invention include:**
- Innovations are complex and might lead to simplifications that deviate from the original design or stem from misunderstandings.
- Lack of adequate knowledge among users, such as providing SaaS tools in languages not suitable for all users within a global organisation.
- Innovations with broad applications may require additional features to maximise their utility, like a CRM tool needing extra integrations.
- Expanding beyond the original scope of an innovation often necessitates customization to address a wider range of user needs.
- Cultural factors can drive local pride of ownership, prompting users to modify the innovation to reflect their personal or regional identity, sometimes resulting in superficial changes labelled as "pseudo-re-invention."
- Influences from agencies or consultants can lead to modifications, although innovation teams may resist changes unless they align with customer needs.
- Organisational structure can also dictate the extent and nature of customization.

As more adopters use the innovation, reinvention occurs, addressing initial flaws or gaps in the innovation.

Re-invention not only enhances the original innovation but also incorporates adopter feedback, making it more comprehensive and suited to real-world applications. **“Articrafts are not only constructed by designers, they are also reconstructed by the users.”** 

## Confirmation Stage:

In this stage, customers seek validation for the innovation they have adopted. Exposure to conflicting feedback may prompt them to reconsider their decision.

Human behaviour at this stage is often driven by a state of internal disequilibrium or dissonance, which is an uncomfortable mental state that individuals seek to alleviate. This reduction in dissonance can occur in several ways:
- When customers are fully aware of their needs and actively seek relevant information, they find reassurance.
- If customers are aware of the innovation but have not adopted it due to a lack of favourable attitudes, experiencing dissonance might motivate them to adopt it, aligning their beliefs with their actions.
- Disappointment with the innovation can arise if there is inadequate support, premature discontinuation, or unclear communication about the innovation’s benefits post-adoption.

Discontinuance refers to the decision to reject the innovation after initially accepting it. There are generally two types of discontinuance:
- **Replacement:** Where the original innovation is discarded in favor of a better solution.
- **Disenchantment:** Stemming from dissatisfaction with the innovation’s performance or outcomes due to its misuse or inherent flaws.


## Conclusion:
It's challenging to definitively say whether these five stages are sufficient to persuade a customer to adopt an innovation. Their effectiveness can vary depending on the specific innovation and the market context. These stages help simplify the complex process of adoption by segmenting it into manageable parts, tailored to meet the needs of different teams within an organisation based on customer behaviour.

It may not always be clear to individuals when they transition from one stage to another, and sharp distinctions between each stage are not always necessary. However, the structure of responsibilities within a company typically dictates which team handles each stage, starting from Marketing, then moving to Business Development & Sales, followed by Operations, Customer Success, and circling back to Marketing. Although these distinctions are mainly for accountability, the overarching goal remains to achieve customer satisfaction with the innovation collectively as a team.

To effectively monitor and guide the innovation decision process, each stage should have specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Achieving these KPIs may depend on employing various communication channels, each playing a crucial role in influencing consumer decisions and generating outcomes.
