Hi, I've setup my new website on GitHub Pages. Happy to be here. It was a fun experience. 

Thanks to Sasank! I've learnt the difference between static and dynamic website. Would love to learn more and be part of the community. 

Happy to move out of WordPress, a dynamic site to Jekyll, a static site. I am excited that my site will be much faster.
