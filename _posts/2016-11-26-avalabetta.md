It doesn't matter how many people are around you. You know better when you are alone. Understanding the life, realizing the truth! A chance to know, a choice to correct.! :P :P :P

All the above philosophy is because I did a solo long ride. Basically it doesn't relate to topic. ;)

It's been quite some time I went some where out for a ride or a trip. It's the first thought running in my mind on a Sunday evening. When the weekend is about to end. I've decided to go somewhere all alone the next day. It's a holiday on Monday. So,not a problem. After a long thing for 10 seconds I decided for **_Avalabetta_**.

Challenges are 100 km ride, getting up at 3:30 AM. Second one looks little scary but manageable. ;)

After setting alarm at 3:30 AM, I slept happily at 1:00AM. Finally after too many snooze's in my phone, I stood erect at 5:00 AM. Kick start the bike at 5:36 AM. On the roads..

A beautiful ride out of silicon city of India with no traffic. Rare experience in fact. It did not take me lot of time to realize that there is some one else who's riding his chariot with me. Sunrise..!! Nature..Such a beauty it is.

When the color of sky is slowly changing to blue and sun is turning white,  I thought the bike need a break. :P That's when I noticed this beauty. Not just flowers but the father and relation. The way he's trying to get his son best shot among those flowers. The way he's trying to make his son the attraction among those attractions.

Now my next stop is at Avalabetta hill top.! After riding almost 79 km taking a left at peresandra cross from AH43 will let towards Avalbetta. Seeing the road in the beginning scared me if I have to ride next 18km on the same road. But after few miles it looked better and then it was fine. Villagers around, beautiful grape vines, lovely cows, pretty flowers along the road till the hill bottom gave a pleasant ride.

Starting to ride to top of the hill could be tricky sometimes. Due to curves and no caution boards anywhere. Honking while turning keeps safe ride for people on either sides. Good part is the road up the hill. It's nicely laid.

After parking the bike to make further hill top by foot, the first thing I noticed was the monkeys. The first thing in my mind after that was, Well,when there are already enough monkeys here, how come there are more coming up on bikes and cars and making the place over crowded. :P

Walking up the hill enjoying the scenic beauty was so mesmerizing. I don't know whether it is nature or man made but there is a small pond like thing may be rain water harvesting.

When the whole crowd over there is busy taking selfies and pictures, I found a nice beautiful place to just see the scenic beauty. Watching the parrots flying from tree to tree.. green birds in greens..!!

Watching nature is so amazing.. Understanding it is some kind of cosmopolitan theory.. How did that beauty grow there? Who is responsible? How is nature helping itself ? Despite so many ill habits from humans nature is trying to heal hard. Great to watch. Nature should be enjoyed, it shouldn't be disturbed. After so many things in mind, I thought I should also take pic and asked some one over there.

It was so nice of them for this click, PC : Lokesh, if I am not wrong that's his name.

After a deep satisfaction for the peaceful time. I started back with lot of energy. Thanks to the nature..!!

Only on the way back I realized that I was cheated by the petrol guy with the distance I traveled. Difference I felt. We expect a lot and we don't get satisfied. Nature doesn't expect anything but still is stays calm and cool until it looses patience.
