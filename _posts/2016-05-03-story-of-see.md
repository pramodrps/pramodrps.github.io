Once upon a time..!! I don't know the reason,but most of the boring stories open like that, this one as well. So, there lived a few friends in a place called Happiness. Yes, you read it right. The place is called "Happiness". Everything in this place is different, everybody here are unique. Our heroes of the story- Someone, Everyone,No one, Sorry, Excuse and Explanation. They are the best friends. Grew together like a thick forest where outsiders get scared to enter inside. As strong as a mountain. But surprisingly or not, they are unique as mentioned earlier. Different characters, nothing to match. Not a single quality, except for one! Their bonding, the  RELATION. It envy's lot of them in their surroundings.

To add more colors to their life, they got wings too. Time to fly for the future. They all happened to go to the same place named "Busy".  Busy is a city where the people are big but hearts are small. People with interesting dreams but disgusting lives. All the friends settled in three corners of the city. New numbers are exchanged for daily calls, promises are made for weekend meets.

Days are passing by, "Everyone" wants to meet all his friends, but he couldn't. He only could became much closer to "Sorry". They are always together. Since, Sorry is Everyone's inner being. They are not two but one. Hearing the word from his friends he became much much closer to sorry.!!!

"Everyone" leaving his self respect aside, putting his love for friends in heart and value for relationship in mind, he  called "Someone" to find if he is free,

"Someone" replied:

" Hey Bro, nice hearing from you. I wish I could meet you guys. But I got some important stuff to do. It may not be possible this weekend. May be next weekend..!!"

He explained it well. Because "Explanation" is "Someone's" inner being. Everyone moved even more closer to sorry and searched for the next number starting with N.

Dialing "No-One":

Tring.. Tring..... ... Tring.. Tring....  Tring.. Tring.....

Beep Beep..

> " The number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable, try calling later." said the voice.
> 
> "Try not calling again ", said my inner voice.!

Minutes passed.. hours went away.. Dates changed.. But the reply is not there.. Because No-One is busy with his inner one i.e.,Excuse.!!!

Everyone realizes that it's all about priorities. When our world increases the priorities change. It may be a genuine excuse, but in the process of explaining the excuse regularly the priority will be on telling excuse.

Office, Meetings, Managers, Leads, Colleagues, Sub-Ordinates, Team dinner, movies with staff, etc etc.. So many things to do. I'm Sorry..!! I am too busy. Well the city of BUSY..! It stands for the New World..New Dreams..New Relations.!! It has a new place in it named "Enjoyment."

But the fact is,

> "Enjoyment comes from Happiness but people think the vice versa."

Even more funnier fact is,

> In the process of the happenings, there is always a place for "No", there is always a place for "May be" and there is always a place for "Yes", it's just a choice we make or priority we choose.!

\---Yours Any One!!
