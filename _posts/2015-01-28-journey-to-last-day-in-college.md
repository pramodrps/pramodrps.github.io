_The day when I started for the first time from my home to college. I have a lot of things running in my mind giving me enough time to think for such a long journey of 30 hours on train. Started to think about new dreams, more likely to say day dreams.. :P I wanted to be part of most of the events in college..  ;) learn lot of things practically... :O study well.. :P blah..blah..blah.. Like an average graduation student in the beginning I thought of doing all impractical things practically.. fun it is.. thinking alone, not doing any of those of-course ;) :)_

            _Funny thing is we cannot remember answer in exams which we studied last night :P but we remember the_ first _day of college even on last day of college.. :) because we love the moment.. because we wait for that moment.. There is a relation you get in college which is not connected to you as a sister, brother, mother,father, nothing.. not even blood.. but stays strong.. FRIENDSHIP.. People we get here are the most inestimable ones of our life.. no egos.. no regrets.. nothing they expect.. not even love.. they care selflessly.._  _**Looks long when we begin but hard to finish when it ends**.. college life... School teaches alphabets to manage upcoming subjects whereas college teaches alphabets to manage upcoming life.. Teachers teach patience.. seniors teach work.. juniors teach responsibility... watchman teaches rules.. mess food teaches importance of food.. :p and friends teach everything..  We come as strangers but the certitude we built in each other is imperishable._ 

_We talk about graduation we remember assignments, periodicals, class tests, surprise tests, presentations, submissions, labs, records, in-completions, dead lines etc..etc.. etc.. But the real fun lies when we together copy assignments :p late night birthday parties, combined studies with one day batting before exams, late night computer games..... ;) hostel wakes up when all the world is asleep..._

_In schools teachers are hard to manage.. but in college records are much more harder to handle than teachers... Grr.. technology comes and we studying B.Tech still write records.. ;) :p Sorry, we wrote records, its about end now.. :P. Its even hard to manage food too.. :P yep.. Where ever you are and whatever college you are studying at.. It doesn't matter you'll definitely miss the home food.. ;) :) We ll know the importance of it.. ;) Other way of looking at it..Again its college teaching us the importance of food.. :P :P_ 

_Mother teaches how to talk.. dad teaches how to walk..__Teacher teaches what to talk.. College teaches right way to walk..__Mom teaches us to be happy.. college teaches us to keep everyone happy.._  

_hundred of demands, thousand of problems, so many issues, ego clashes, regional problems, language barriers what not.. all the problems on earth are faced here in college.. but still we give a damn to all these.. everyone of us.. Our only problem is the outside world. It stops our freedom.. Our only issue is our marks. It ruins our intelligence... :P There may be hundred and one things but we mange them.. we love them.._  

_The day we end.. first prayer : May this day be the longest one of ever.. We all pray.. may our relation be like this forever.. But there is long journey to travel on.. life moves on.. This is a junction of love to learn on how to travel alone further.. Future awaits.. We are immature fruits till now.. We grew big enough with help of everyone around.. being secured that no one will throw a stone at us. But now one we strive to be ripened fruit with parrots and crows pricking us.. squirrels eating us... people throwing stones.. But still our aim is to become a well ripen fruit and grow like another tree from its seeds to give life to another family of fruits and trees. :) :) :)_ 

    _With new hopes and new dreams started my journey for my future..Now I have the same feeling of which I had when I began my graduation... Same kind of confusion.. but a better clarity than before.. ;)_
