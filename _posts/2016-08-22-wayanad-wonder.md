He was standing there in the first floor of that under construction house. I don’t know what it could be called. That wall there is open and it’s as big as 70mm movie theatre screen. Water spread everywhere on the floor. Only then I noticed him in the reflection of water, watching the distant greens, on the gigantic mountains in front. Noticing the moving mist like thing in the reflection I lifted my head up to see what it is? I slowly walked towards him. Looked into his eyes, they are wide open with a surprise filled in those eyes. It excited me to look what is that.

The beautiful Bansura hill, which is covered with thick blanket of cumulus type of clouds.  That thick clouds moving over those greens, touching the tip of trees. Now it’s my turn to keep my mouth open. Then he said, let’s climb up there to touch those clouds. My eyes widened. And I said Yes!!!

That evening two of us set to climb up that hill. Along that small path, crossing the elephant dung, jumping over the small streams, feeling the essence of that long lemon grass everywhere.

Scratches due to that sharp grass on legs or the blood that leaches are sucking from our legs did not worry us but those abandoned houses and half constructed houses in that wild area surprised us. That trees which are lying down with elephants trunk mark and their foot marks in that premises.

After quickly plucking and eating few guava’s in that half spoiled place we started ahead. From far everything looked like just grass. But it’s just 6 feet tall, the grass. Crossing all those we started walking up. Since its rainy season it’s all wet. Luckily it didn’t rain. If it did we would have happily slipped to the foot of the banasura without any effort. But nature helped us with peaceful weather. As we are nearing to the tip of the hill the world we are seeing is becoming bigger and bigger with beauty.

Finally after slipping 2-3 times on the way, we almost reached to the tip. But there is something fishy. When I looked at my palms they looked dark with traces of ash. With a surprise I looked around. He asked me what? I showed my hand. He removed his hand from the dead tree branch and only then we noticed the tree which is dark. Forest fire, must be. There is always dark side on beautiful part. Nature got no exemption on it too. Now we understand why there is only grass on the top and no trees. Finally on the peak of the hill. Interestingly, we are not on the right one. There is one more gigantic hill in-front of us with a big waterfall on it. The actual Banasura it is. :P

Nature at its best. He asked me, Can you believe this? Just both of us. Such a peaceful place with the sound of water from the falls. It’s experiencing the gravity and we are experiencing its beauty. I shook my head speaking with eyes filling myself into the magic of nature. When crickets started their music concert, we understood that sun is setting down and moon is ready to glow.

![IMG_20160719_174259788_HDR](images/img_20160719_174259788_hdr1.jpg)We started back. Excitement bought us till the tip not understanding how steep the hill is to climb. Only now we realized more fun is yet to come. We kept going down slowly and noticed that there is a surprise for us. A big rock, one more step and our next foot print will touch 15 feet down almost. We slowly moved back and found another route. In between, we had sit down and crawl a bit too. So that, we don’t roll down without our interference in doing that. ;)

On the way back we noticed big steps of the elephants and wondered how these animals managed this route when we are struggling a lot. Finally, after a huge struggle and lot of happiness we reached back. Now it’s time for a quick shower under nature. We jumped into the flowing stream where our friends are already in. They stared at us with aggrieved look as we ditched them by not telling where we have gone. But friends wouldn’t mind at the end. We shared our experiences convincingly two of us walked back to our camp with our friends to set the camp fire. ;)

The world is so beautiful, to keep it as such we just have to do Nothing..!! Make sure we don't disturb nature. See the nature, enjoy it.. feel it.. Don't disturb it..

Finally, A big bow to the nature..
