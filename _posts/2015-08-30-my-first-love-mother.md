I don't know how happy I am when I won entering into my mothers womb. But, I am damn sure she overwhelmed with happiness and joy when she came to know that I am in there in like a seed growing to pierce out like a plant. Yeah.! She knows that there is lot of suffering on the way. But the happiness she had that moment buried all her feelings for suffering. The beauty of Motherhood it is...!! How great it is?

          I started consuming everything she is taking in. I am growing stronger day by day when she is growing weak consecutively. But still the same happiness. Weakness is constrained only to body but joy is growing inside heart even though her womb is growing. I doubt if there is any living being on this earth which can feel happy with increasing pain if not Mother.

     Finally I am out into the world where there is too much light and I started crying unable to bear the light in my eyes. People around me started consoling me where my mother was cheering with happiness. Strange moment,

> _The only moment_  _when_ _Mother can smile when her baby is crying...!! How beautiful_

I thought my mother would be happy if I cry since I experienced it when I was born. So, I started crying from then on but soon I realized how much mental torture she is bearing seeing me like that..! How idiotic I am? She protected me every second.. She was awake all night to make me sleep peacefully..! She even slept on the bed which became wet because of me..

> _Every time I cried of suffering, she had scalding in her heart..._
> 
> _Every time she fed me milk, she forgot her hunger..._
> 
> _Every time I got hurt, tears rolled down from her eyes before mine..._

How sweet she is. How can someone be so sweet?? Everyone answers that she is mother so obvious that she will protect her kid. But whats the logic in it?

> _Where did she get patience which is as high as sky!_
> 
> _How can she shower so much love which is as vast as an Ocean!_
> 
> _How can she bond with her kid so nicely which is as beautiful as rainbow!_

After thinking about that great personality who is in my life, I was not understanding how can I repay this? Will that be possible? The most funny thing is even after so much of suffering in her life because of me my mother thinks her life was beautiful because of me.. All because of me alone...!! All I can do for such beautiful lady in my life is do dasoham(servant) at her feet as long as I exist in all my births..

I always think the phrases I learnt from my dad

> _Matha Pitha Guru Daivam...._

Where mother is given first preference and then comes father, teacher and God.. In that case I will definitely not say

> _Mathrudevobhava_

Because, how can I compare mother with god where mother was given first preference in first place? So Instead I would say god as mother  rather than mother as god..

Love you amma.. !!! I am happy to be part of you and thank you is something which is 0..0001% of what you did for me...  All I can do is be at your service till my last breath.
