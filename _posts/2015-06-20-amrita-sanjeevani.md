The more you love the more attached you are to it..!!

**M**ost of the people complaint/complement depending on their situation that, i know most of the people in my college... That may be because I love participating in most of the events and I was well-known with my art work..

But my painting in college started in a beautiful place in my college.. AMRITA SANJEEVANI, student owned social service organisation in Amrita university. It's not only a place to help but to learn too.. yeah.. I heard people talk about pros and cons when mentioned about it. But this place gave me a lot in life.. It taught me the life, it taught me love, it taught me care, it taught me many more..

I always wanted to go to an orphanage, an old age home, a cleanup drive, gardening, camps and camp fires, cycle rally etc.. and many more.. But I never knew I can do all these one beautiful place and that will exist in college itself.. Funny isn't it? Yeah..! I have been a part of all those and many more which I never expected I will be doing. Ya, true college life will have other fun's too. We can go to a movie, spend a night in a house boat on a weekend and that too especially when you study in Kerala.But,

I believed in that. I wanted to be a part of so many beautiful kids smiles and happiness in poor old ones. I went in joined it. Wah..! What a wonderful receiving. Encouragement on every step.. There are no seniors, no juniors, no teachers, nothing.. beautiful relations and memorable events.

I re-started painting there.. In fact my first painting I did in my college was printed in College news letter SamVed which went through Sanjeevani again. Interesting thing is I painted the logo too for the same magazine which made me feel memorable. After that I did lot of creative things in my four years of graduation time and that brought me a lot of name.

I was happy when I am enjoying burning the crackers all alone at home when I am in my +2 but when the time went by and a year passed and the same Diwali day there are tears rolling down my cheek. Not because I am away from home, not because I am unable to celebrate Diwali at home, simply to say the tears rolling down are due to the happiness I encountered that day. Yes, I went to an Orphanage for the first time in my life spent my beautiful day with all those kids there. Played with those kids till the sweat rolled down and water poured out of my body. I danced with them, I ate with them, I burnt cracker with them. I was never satisfied when I was burning thousand rupees worth crackers at home but it gave me immense pleasure when one of the kids was burning one cracker worth five rupees. Sanjeevani.. !

Gandhi house-Old age home, I went inside with a language barrier expecting that I will remain silent when all my friends who know Malayalam would be busy talking to all the granny's there. But to my surprise I met a lady there who is from Tamil Nadu and even more surprising thing for me was she did PhD in Psychology and she knows a lot better English than I speak. She made my day. She shared a lot of interesting things of that place. Lot of people leave their parents here and go, but the old people there are lot heartened who adopt the orphaned kids and take care of them till they come to school age. They feel those orphaned kids too need grandparents love. Interesting isn't it? That was when I felt are those old ones inside left there because they became the burden? Crazy people. I feel pity for the people who think that their old parents are the burden for them. They are not destined for love and touch of their parents forever.

Swacch-Bharat began when Modi became the PM of India. But I became part of the same drive on August 15th,2011 for the first time. I never understood the importance of clean up drive until I went to Sabarimala cleanup drive. Located in the scenic Western Ghats, surrounded by a dense jungle, the famous temple of Sabrimala in Kerala draws millions of pilgrims every year. Devotees make the arduous trek up the mountain to offer prayers to Lord Ayyappan, usually after undergoing a period of strict spiritual vows. But this dense jungle with this famous temple has waste left uncleaned for about 20-25 years. Even the priest doesn't know when the temple was cleaned for the last time. We 1000 students and another 3500 volunteers became part of a project where the place is cleaned for one whole week with everyone residing amidst the mountains. Resulting Zero waste project is initiated by Chief Minister himself to protect the sanctity and purity of that beautiful place. It made me feel privileged to be part of such an event. Yeah Sanjeevani gave me chance again.

Amrita Sanjeevani, it made me feel prerogative to be part of many more such good events in life. On the day of my induction in college we were told Amrita University believes not only in Education for Life but also Education for living too. I understood why they told us that only after finishing my graduation. Sanjeevani became part of many of my dreams and in fulfilling them. If I ever did something good for the society it's all because of Sanjeevani. It's not an experience but a memory for me to be part of the people and kindness there.. Thank you all for making me feel so much special of myself by letting me do something good which I never expected would be possible...!!!
